    MAP OF WHERE UPGRADES ARE MANAGED WITHIN THE CODE 

    === General Functions === 
    - See the class "UNIT_Train_If_Applicable", which manages all of this. 

    === Object-specific (All of these must be in place for a specific unit to train) === 
    - Unit Class -> Contains all data for the nits. 
    - Unit Object Definition: 
        * The unit must be defined in the main loop, e.g through 'knight=Unit("knight")'
        * The unit must be recruited in the main loop through the function " UNIT_Train_If_Applicable(knight, listener.stables)"
        - ðŸ”¯ As far as i know, there are no other object-specific references to the unit.
            * <<< ðŸ”¯ðŸ”¯The above text can easily be verified by simply searching on "archer" and see at how many places it appears.  

    - Upgrade Class -> Contains all data for the upgrades, EXCEPT which TYPE(s) of unit has to be present to train the upgrade. 
    - "UPGRADE_Requirements_Age_AlreadyResearched_EnoughUnits": 
        * Check the requirements for Age, AlreadyResearched and Enough units.
        * Also determined which TYPE OF UNIT is needed. 
    - Upgrade Object definition: Done after the main-loop-function is defined in the main script.  
    - LÃ¤gg in uniten i CalculateCurrentCost_PER_SECOND sÃ¥ att det ska rÃ¤knas ut.
